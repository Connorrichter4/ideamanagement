To run this project go to root folder and run

`mvn spring-boot:run` and go to ui folder and do `npm install && npm start` if everythings works well, go to `http://localhost:3000` and register yourself and login and play with the application.

Mind you, this can be used as a standard stack for full stack application for enterprise web development.
